üî∑ Configuring Azure Active Directory Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for Groups

üéØ **Objective:**
Control and monitor access to sensitive resources by configuring Azure AD PIM for groups, ensuring secure authentication for group members.

üåü **Why does this matter?:**
Azure AD PIM for groups provides a secure way to grant temporary access to users in a group, enhancing security and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive resources.

üí° **Use cases:**
- Managing access to sensitive resources
- Enhancing security for group-based access
- Monitoring and controlling group memberships

üõ†Ô∏è **Steps to completion:**

### Task 1: Create a Basic Group and Add Members

1. **Create a basic group and add members:**
   - Use the Azure portal or Azure CLI to create a new group and add members.
     ```bash
     az ad group create --display-name "PIM-Group" --mail-nickname "PIMGroup"
     az ad group member add --group "PIM-Group" --member-id <user_object_id>
     ```

### Task 2: Bring the Group into Privileged Identity Management (preview)

2. **Bring the group into Privileged Identity Management:**
   - Discover and manage the group in PIM.
     ```bash
     az pim group add --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name "PIM-Group"
     ```

### Task 3: Configure Azure AD to Assign Eligibility for a Group (preview) in Privileged Identity Management

3.1 **Assign an owner or member of a group:**
   - Assign eligibility for a group member or owner role.
     ```bash
     az pim group assignment create --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name "PIM-Group" --principal-id <user_object_id> --role "Owner"
     ```

3.2 **Update or remove an existing role assignment:**
   - Update or remove the role assignment as needed.
     ```bash
     az pim group assignment update --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name "PIM-Group" --principal-id <user_object_id> --role "Member"
     az pim group assignment delete --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name "PIM-Group" --principal-id <user_object_id>
     ```

### Task 4: Configure Privileged Identity Management for Groups Settings (preview)

4. **Configure Privileged Identity Management for Groups settings:**
   - Set up specific PIM settings for groups.
     ```bash
     az pim group settings update --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name "PIM-Group" --settings @settings.json
     ```

### Task 5: Activate Your Group Membership or Ownership in Privileged Identity Management

5.1 **Activate a role:**
   - Activate your group membership or ownership role.
     ```bash
     az pim role activate --role-name "Owner" --group "PIM-Group"
     ```

5.2 **View the status of your requests:**
   - Check the status of your activation requests.
     ```bash
     az pim role request list --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name "PIM-Group"
     ```

5.3 **Cancel a pending request:**
   - Cancel any pending activation requests if necessary.
     ```bash
     az pim role request cancel --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name "PIM-Group" --request-id <request_id>
     ```

### Task 6: Approve Activation Requests for Group Members and Owners (preview)

6.1 **View pending requests:**
   - Review pending activation requests.
     ```bash
     az pim role request list --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name "PIM-Group" --status "Pending"
     ```

6.2 **Approve requests:**
   - Approve the activation requests for group members and owners.
     ```bash
     az pim role request approve --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name "PIM-Group" --request-id <request_id>
     ```

### Task 7: Extend or Renew PIM for Groups Assignments (preview)

7.1 **Self-extend expiring assignments:**
   - Extend expiring assignments for yourself.
     ```bash
     az pim role assignment extend --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name "PIM-Group" --principal-id <user_object_id>
     ```

7.2 **Approve the extension by Admin:**
   - Admin approval for extending the assignment.
     ```bash
     az pim role assignment approve --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name "PIM-Group" --principal-id <user_object_id>
     ```

### Task 8: Delete the Resources You Created for This Exercise

8. **Clean up resources to avoid unnecessary costs:**
   - Remove the resources created during this exercise.
     ```bash
     az group delete --name <resource_group_name> --yes --no-wait
     az ad group delete --id "PIM-Group"
     ```

‚ö° **Tip:**
Regularly assess whether you need the resources post-exercise to avoid extra costs.
