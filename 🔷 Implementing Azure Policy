üî∑ Implementing Azure Policy

üéØ **Objective:**
Create and enforce a policy that restricts available locations for new resources to North Central US and East US, ensuring geo-compliance.

üåü **Why does this matter?:**
Azure Policies help enforce organizational standards and ensure compliance by controlling the properties of resources during deployment and throughout their lifecycle.

üí° **Use cases:**
- Enforcing geo-compliance requirements
- Restricting resource locations
- Ensuring organizational standards

üõ†Ô∏è **Steps to completion:**

1. **Create a resource group:**
   - Use the Azure portal or Azure CLI to create a resource group named `AZ500LAB01`.
     ```bash
     az group create --name AZ500LAB01 --location "East US"
     ```

2. **Create a custom Azure Policy definition:**
   - Define a policy that restricts resource locations to North Central US and East US.
     ```bash
     az policy definition create --name "allowed-locations" --rules '
     {
       "if": {
         "not": {
           "field": "location",
           "in": ["northcentralus", "eastus"]
         }
       },
       "then": {
         "effect": "deny"
       }
     }
     ' --description "This policy allows only North Central US and East US locations." --display-name "Allowed Locations"
     ```

3. **Assign the Azure Policy to the resource group:**
   - Assign the created policy to the `AZ500LAB01` resource group.
     ```bash
     az policy assignment create --policy "allowed-locations" --resource-group AZ500LAB01 --name "enforce-allowed-locations"
     ```

4. **Test the policy:**
   - Attempt to create a resource in a location other than North Central US or East US to ensure the policy is enforced correctly.
     ```bash
     az vm create --resource-group AZ500LAB01 --name TestVM --image Win2019Datacenter --location "westus" --admin-username <admin_username> --admin-password <admin_password>
     ```

5. **Clean up resources:**
   - Remove the resources and policy assignments to avoid unnecessary costs.
     ```bash
     az policy assignment delete --name "enforce-allowed-locations" --resource-group AZ500LAB01
     az policy definition delete --name "allowed-locations"
     az group delete --name AZ500LAB01 --yes --no-wait
     ```

‚ö° **Tip:**
Regularly assess whether you need the resources post-exercise to avoid extra costs.

In this work sample, I successfully implemented and enforced an Azure Policy to restrict resource locations, demonstrating my ability to ensure geo-compliance and enforce organizational standards. This showcases my proficiency in using Azure Policy to control and manage resource properties effectively. üåüüõ°Ô∏è
