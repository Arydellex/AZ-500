🔷 Implementing Microsoft Defender for Cloud

🎯 **Objective:**
Secure your application from cyber threats by enabling enhanced security features using Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

🌟 **Why does this matter?:**
Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides comprehensive security measures, helping to protect cloud-based applications from cyber threats and vulnerabilities.

💡 **Use cases:**
- Securing cloud-based applications
- Monitoring and improving security posture
- Detecting and responding to security threats

🛠️ **Steps to completion:**

1. **Review Microsoft Defender for Cloud on your Azure subscription:**
   - Access Microsoft Defender for Cloud to review the current security posture.
     ```bash
     az security assessment list --resource-group <resource_group_name> --query "[].{Name:name, Status:status}"
     ```

2. **Enable Microsoft Defender plans to get the enhanced security features:**
   - Enable the Microsoft Defender plans for enhanced security.
     ```bash
     az security pricing create --name "Standard" --tier "Standard"
     ```

3. **Configure email notifications for security alerts:**
   - Set up email notifications to receive security alerts.
     ```bash
     az security contact create --name <contact_name> --email <email_address> --alert-admins "On"
     ```

4. **Clean up resources:**
   - Remove the resources created for this exercise to avoid unnecessary costs.
     ```bash
     az security pricing delete --name "Standard"
     az group delete --name <resource_group_name> --yes --no-wait
     ```

⚡ **Tip:**
Regularly assess whether you need the resources post-exercise to avoid extra costs.
