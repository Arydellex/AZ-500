🔷 Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Role Assignments

🎯 **Objective:**
Create a resource group, assign role assignments to users, and manage access effectively.

🌟 **Why does this matter?:**
RBAC helps manage who has access to Azure resources, what they can do with those resources, and what areas they have access to, enhancing security and operational efficiency.

💡 **Use cases:**
- Managing access to Azure resources
- Assigning roles and permissions
- Controlling resource access

🛠️ **Steps to completion:**

### Task 1: Access the Azure Portal and Create a Resource Group

1. **Create a resource group:**
   - Use the Azure portal or Azure CLI to create a new resource group.
     ```bash
     az group create --name AZ500LAB01 --location "East US"
     ```

### Task 2: Assign Roles to Grant a User Access to Azure Resource

2. **Assign roles:**
   - Assign a role to a user to grant them access to the resource group created in Task 1.
     ```bash
     az role assignment create --assignee <user_object_id> --role "Contributor" --resource-group AZ500LAB01
     ```

### Task 3: Check the Role Assignment for Yourself

3. **Check your role assignment:**
   - Verify your role assignment within the Azure subscription.
     ```bash
     az role assignment list --assignee <your_object_id> --all
     ```

### Task 4: Check the Role Assignments for a Resource Group

4. **Check role assignments for the resource group:**
   - List all role assignments for the resource group created in Task 1.
     ```bash
     az role assignment list --resource-group AZ500LAB01
     ```

### Task 5: Check and Explore Roles

5. **Explore roles:**
   - Check and explore different roles available in Azure.
     ```bash
     az role definition list --query "[].{RoleName:roleName, Description:description}"
     ```

### Task 6: Remove Azure Role Assignment Access

6. **Remove role assignment:**
   - Remove the role assignment created in Task 2.
     ```bash
     az role assignment delete --assignee <user_object_id> --role "Contributor" --resource-group AZ500LAB01
     ```

### Task 7: Delete the Resources Created for This Exercise

7. **Clean up resources:**
   - Remove the resource group and all associated resources to avoid unnecessary costs.
     ```bash
     az group delete --name AZ500LAB01 --yes --no-wait
     ```

⚡ **Tip:**
Regularly assess whether you need the resources post-exercise to avoid extra costs.
