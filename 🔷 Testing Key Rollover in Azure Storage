🔷 Testing Key Rollover in Azure Storage

🎯 **Objective:**
Test key rollover using Azure Storage Explorer to ensure secure access management.

🌟 **Why does this matter?:**
Key rollover is essential to maintain security in Azure storage. By regenerating and updating access keys, we prevent unauthorized access and reduce the risk of exposure.

💡 **Use cases:**
- Regular security maintenance for cloud storage
- Securing access to sensitive data
- Compliance with security policies

🛠️ **Steps to completion:**

1. **Download and install Azure Storage Explorer:**
   - Get the tool from the official website.
     ```bash
     # Download Azure Storage Explorer
     # URL: https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/
     ```

2. **Connect to Azure Storage:**
   - Use the access keys from your Storage account to connect in Azure Storage Explorer.
   - Verify navigation to Storage account content.
     ```bash
     # Use Azure Storage Explorer interface to connect and verify access
     ```

3. **Regenerate the storage account key:**
   - Regenerate the key and verify that authentication fails.
     ```bash
     az storage account keys regenerate --account-name <storage_account_name> --key primary
     ```

4. **Reconnect using regenerated keys:**
   - Update the connection in Azure Storage Explorer with the new keys and verify access.
     ```bash
     # Update Azure Storage Explorer with regenerated keys
     ```

5. **Clean up resources:**
   - Delete resources to avoid unnecessary costs.
     ```bash
     az storage account delete --name <storage_account_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name>
     ```

⚡ **Tip:**
Always assess the necessity of resources post-exercise to avoid extra costs.
