üî∑ Configuring Azure Active Directory Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for Roles and Resources

üéØ **Objective:**
Manage, control, and monitor access to important resources using Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) by configuring and testing roles and resource settings.

üåü **Why does this matter?:**
PIM enhances security and governance by controlling access to resources, ensuring that privileged roles are assigned and activated only when necessary.

üí° **Use cases:**
- Managing access to Azure AD, Azure, and other Microsoft Online Services
- Enhancing security for privileged roles
- Monitoring and controlling resource access

üõ†Ô∏è **Steps to completion:**

### Task 1: Configure Azure AD Privileged Identity Management for Azure AD Roles

1. **Configure Azure AD role settings in Privileged Identity Management:**
   - Access the Azure portal and navigate to Azure AD PIM.
     ```bash
     az role definition list --name "Billing Administrator"
     ```

2. **Assign Azure AD roles in Privileged Identity Management:**
   - Assign the Billing Administrator role to the user `AZ500User1`.
     ```bash
     az role assignment create --assignee <user_object_id> --role "Billing Administrator"
     ```

3. **Activate the PIM role assigned:**
   - Activate the Billing Administrator role for `AZ500User1`.
     ```bash
     az pim role activate --role-name "Billing Administrator" --user-id <user_object_id>
     ```

4. **Test the activated PIM role:**
   - Verify that the user `AZ500User1` can perform the tasks associated with the Billing Administrator role.

### Task 2: Configure Azure AD Privileged Identity Management for Azure Resources

1. **Configure Azure resource role settings in Privileged Identity Management:**
   - Configure role settings for Azure resources in PIM.
     ```bash
     az role definition list --name "Virtual Machine Contributor"
     ```

2. **Assign the Azure resource role:**
   - Assign the Virtual Machine Contributor role to `AZ500User1` for a specific resource group.
     ```bash
     az role assignment create --assignee <user_object_id> --role "Virtual Machine Contributor" --resource-group <resource_group_name>
     ```

3. **Test the assigned resource role:**
   - Verify that `AZ500User1` can manage virtual machines within the assigned resource group.

### Task 3: Delete the Resources Created for This Exercise

1. **Clean up resources to avoid unnecessary costs:**
   - Remove the resources and roles assigned during this exercise.
     ```bash
     az role assignment delete --assignee <user_object_id> --role "Billing Administrator"
     az role assignment delete --assignee <user_object_id> --role "Virtual Machine Contributor" --resource-group <resource_group_name>
     az group delete --name <resource_group_name> --yes --no-wait
     ```

‚ö° **Tip:**
Regularly assess whether you need the resources post-exercise to avoid extra costs.
