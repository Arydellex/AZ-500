üî∑ Using Playbooks with Automation Rules in Microsoft Sentinel

üéØ **Objective:**
Implement playbooks and automation rules in Microsoft Sentinel to enhance cybersecurity incident response and management.

üåü **Why does this matter?:**
Playbooks and automation rules in Microsoft Sentinel streamline and automate incident response, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of cybersecurity operations.

üí° **Use cases:**
- Automating responses to security incidents
- Streamlining threat detection and response processes
- Enhancing overall security posture

üõ†Ô∏è **Steps to completion:**

1. **Enable Microsoft Sentinel:**
   - Use the Azure portal or Azure CLI to enable Microsoft Sentinel.
     ```bash
     az sentinel create --resource-group <resource_group_name> --workspace-name <workspace_name> --location "East US"
     ```

2. **Prepare the playbook and Logic App:**
   - Create a Logic App that will serve as the playbook in Microsoft Sentinel.
     ```bash
     az logicapp create --resource-group <resource_group_name> --location "East US" --name <playbook_name> --definition @playbook-definition.json
     ```

3. **Add actions:**
   - Define the actions that the playbook will take in response to an incident.
     ```bash
     az logicapp action create --resource-group <resource_group_name> --logic-app-name <playbook_name> --action-name <action_name> --definition @action-definition.json
     ```

4. **Respond to incident and alerts:**
   - Configure automation rules in Microsoft Sentinel to trigger the playbook based on specific incidents or alerts.
     ```bash
     az sentinel automation-rule create --resource-group <resource_group_name> --workspace-name <workspace_name> --name <automation_rule_name> --trigger-type "Incident" --logic-app-resource-id <logic_app_resource_id>
     ```

5. **Run a playbook manually on an incident:**
   - Manually trigger the playbook for a specific incident in Microsoft Sentinel.
     ```bash
     az sentinel incident trigger-playbook --resource-group <resource_group_name> --workspace-name <workspace_name> --incident-id <incident_id> --playbook-name <playbook_name>
     ```

6. **Delete the resources you created for this exercise:**
   - Remove the resources created for this exercise to avoid unnecessary costs.
     ```bash
     az group delete --name <resource_group_name> --yes --no-wait
     ```

‚ö° **Tip:**
Regularly assess whether you need the resources post-exercise to avoid extra costs.
