üî∑ Create and Manage Groups in Azure AD

üéØ **Objective:**
Use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to create and manage groups, enhancing organization and access control for users in your organization.

üåü **Why does this matter?:**
Managing groups in Azure AD allows you to streamline user management, improve security, and ensure appropriate access to resources.

üí° **Use cases:**
- Organizing users by department or role
- Simplifying access control
- Managing group memberships dynamically

üõ†Ô∏è **Steps to completion:**

### Task 1: Create a Group for Your Organization

1. **Create a group with the organization manager as the owner and add two employees as members:**
   - Use the Azure portal or Azure CLI to create a new group.
     ```bash
     az ad group create --display-name "OrganizationGroup" --mail-nickname "OrgGroup" --security-enabled false --group-types "Unified"
     az ad group owner add --group "OrganizationGroup" --owner-id <manager_object_id>
     az ad group member add --group "OrganizationGroup" --member-id <employee1_object_id>
     az ad group member add --group "OrganizationGroup" --member-id <employee2_object_id>
     ```

### Task 2: Update Group Membership

2. **Add a new employee as a group member and remove the old employee:**
   - Add the new employee to the group.
     ```bash
     az ad group member add --group "OrganizationGroup" --member-id <new_employee_object_id>
     ```
   - Remove the old employee from the group.
     ```bash
     az ad group member remove --group "OrganizationGroup" --member-id <old_employee_object_id>
     ```

### Task 3: Update Group Details

3. **Provide a description for the group created in Task 1:**
   - Update the group details to include a description of the organization.
     ```bash
     az ad group update --id "OrganizationGroup" --description "This group includes members of the organization."
     ```

### Task 4: Create a Dynamic Group for Departments

4. **Create another group with dynamic membership and add dynamic query:**
   - Create a dynamic user group for all departments in the organization.
     ```bash
     az ad group create --display-name "DepartmentGroup" --mail-nickname "DeptGroup" --security-enabled false --group-types "Unified"
     az ad group update --id "DepartmentGroup" --membership-rule "user.department -eq 'IT'"
     ```

### Task 5: Delete the Organization Group

5. **Delete the organization group created in Task 1:**
   - Remove the organization group.
     ```bash
     az ad group delete --id "OrganizationGroup"
     ```

### Task 6: Restore the Deleted Organization Group

6. **Restore the deleted organization group:**
   - Restore the deleted group.
     ```bash
     az ad group restore --id "OrganizationGroup"
     ```

‚ö° **Tip:**
Regularly assess whether you need the resources post-exercise to avoid extra costs. User and group accounts will be required for subsequent exercises, so consider your billing preferences when deciding to keep or delete them.
