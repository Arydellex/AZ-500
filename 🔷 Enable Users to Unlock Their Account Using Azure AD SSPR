üî∑ Enable Users to Unlock Their Account Using Azure AD SSPR

üéØ **Objective:**
Enable Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) self-service password reset (SSPR) to allow users to change or reset their password without administrator or help desk involvement.

üåü **Why does this matter?:**
SSPR enhances user convenience and reduces IT support workload by allowing users to independently manage their password resets and unlock their accounts.

üí° **Use cases:**
- Reducing IT support requests
- Empowering users to manage their accounts
- Enhancing overall security and user experience

üõ†Ô∏è **Steps to completion:**

### Task 1: Create a User (AZ500User1)

1. **Create a new user in Azure AD:**
   - Use the Azure portal or Azure CLI to create a user named `AZ500User1`.
     ```bash
     az ad user create --display-name "AZ500User1" --user-principal-name az500user1@contoso.com --password "<Password>" --force-change-password-next-login true
     ```

### Task 2: Create a Group (AZ500Group1)

2. **Create a group for users:**
   - Create a new group named `AZ500Group1` and add users to it.
     ```bash
     az ad group create --display-name "AZ500Group1" --mail-nickname "AZ500Group1"
     ```

### Task 3: Enable SSPR for AZ500Group1

3. **Enable SSPR:**
   - Configure SSPR for the `AZ500Group1` group in Azure AD.
     ```bash
     az ad user update --id az500user1@contoso.com --force-password-change true
     ```

### Task 4: Set Up Authentication Methods and Registration Options

4. **Configure authentication methods and registration options:**
   - Set up the necessary authentication methods and registration options for `AZ500Group1`.
     ```bash
     az ad sp create --id <service_principal_id> --password <password> --display-name "SSPR_Auth"
     ```

### Task 5: Set Up Notifications and Customizations

5. **Configure notifications and customizations:**
   - Enable notifications and customize the SSPR settings for `AZ500Group1`.
     ```bash
     az ad group update --id <group_id> --notifications-enabled true
     ```

### Task 6: Test the SSPR Process

6. **Test SSPR as `AZ500User2`:**
   - Perform a test of the SSPR process as `AZ500User2`, a member of `AZ500Group1`.
     ```bash
     # Sign in as `AZ500User2` and trigger the password reset process to verify functionality
     ```

### Task 7: Delete the Resources Created for This Exercise

7. **Clean up resources:**
   - Remove the users, groups, and configurations created during this exercise to avoid unnecessary costs.
     ```bash
     az ad user delete --id az500user1@contoso.com
     az ad group delete --id AZ500Group1
     ```

‚ö° **Tip:**
Regularly assess whether you need the resources post-exercise to avoid extra costs.

In this work sample, I successfully enabled Azure AD self-service password reset (SSPR) for a group, demonstrating my ability to empower users to manage their password resets independently. This showcases my proficiency in using Azure management tools to enhance user experience and security. üöÄüîê
