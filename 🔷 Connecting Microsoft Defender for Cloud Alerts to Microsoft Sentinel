🔷 Connecting Microsoft Defender for Cloud Alerts to Microsoft Sentinel

🎯 **Objective:**
Integrate Microsoft Defender for Cloud with Microsoft Sentinel to enhance threat detection and response capabilities.

🌟 **Why does this matter?:**
Integrating Defender for Cloud with Sentinel allows you to view, analyze, and respond to security alerts and incidents within a broader organizational threat context, improving overall security posture.

💡 **Use cases:**
- Centralized threat detection and response
- Enhancing security operations
- Improving visibility into security incidents

🛠️ **Steps to completion:**

1. **Enable Microsoft Sentinel:**
   - Use the Azure portal or Azure CLI to enable Microsoft Sentinel.
     ```bash
     az sentinel create --resource-group <resource_group_name> --workspace-name <workspace_name> --location "East US"
     ```

2. **Connect to Microsoft Defender for Cloud:**
   - Stream security alerts from Defender for Cloud into Microsoft Sentinel.
     ```bash
     az sentinel data-connector create --resource-group <resource_group_name> --workspace-name <workspace_name> --data-connector-id <data_connector_id> --connector-kind "AzureDefender"
     ```

3. **Cleaning Up the Resources:**
   - Delete the resources created for this exercise to avoid unnecessary costs.
     ```bash
     az group delete --name <resource_group_name> --yes --no-wait
     ```

⚡ **Tip:**
Regularly assess whether you need the resources post-exercise to avoid extra costs.
