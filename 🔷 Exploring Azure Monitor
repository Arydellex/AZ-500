🔷 Exploring Azure Monitor

🎯 **Objective:**
Monitor Azure resources using Azure Monitor to ensure their availability, performance, and smooth operation.

🌟 **Why does this matter?:**
Azure Monitor helps address service disruptions and performance degradation by providing detailed insights and automated alerts, improving team productivity and customer satisfaction.

💡 **Use cases:**
- Monitoring critical applications
- Detecting and resolving performance issues
- Ensuring resource availability and operation

🛠️ **Steps to completion:**

1. **Enable recommended alerts for a new Azure VM when the CPU percentage threshold is greater than 10%:**
   - Set up alerts to monitor CPU usage for the virtual machine.
     ```bash
     az monitor metrics alert create --name "HighCPUAlert" --resource-group <resource_group_name> --scopes /subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<resource_group_name>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/<vm_name> --condition "avg Percentage CPU > 10" --description "Alert if CPU usage is greater than 10%" --action /subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<resource_group_name>/providers/Microsoft.Insights/actionGroups/<action_group_name> --location "East US"
     ```

2. **View the resulting alert rules:**
   - Check the alert rules that have been created to ensure they are correctly set up.
     ```bash
     az monitor metrics alert list --resource-group <resource_group_name> --query "[].{name:name, condition:criteria.conditions[0].conditionType, threshold:criteria.conditions[0].threshold, status:enabled}"
     ```

3. **View the Metrics and Insights of the created VM:**
   - Access the metrics and insights for the VM to monitor its performance.
     ```bash
     az monitor metrics list --resource /subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<resource_group_name>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/<vm_name> --metric-names "Percentage CPU" --aggregation average
     ```

4. **Clean up resources:**
   - Remove the resources created for this exercise to avoid unnecessary costs.
     ```bash
     az monitor metrics alert delete --name "HighCPUAlert" --resource-group <resource_group_name>
     az group delete --name <resource_group_name> --yes --no-wait
     ```

⚡ **Tip:**
Regularly assess whether you need the resources post-exercise to avoid extra costs.
