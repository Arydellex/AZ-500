🔷 Deploying a Container Instance in Azure

🎯 **Objective:**
Deploy a secure Azure Container Instance (ACI) with specific requirements and ensure proper cleanup.

🌟 **Why does this matter?:**
Azure Container Instances provide a fast, easy way to run containers without managing virtual machines. Ensuring these instances are secure and properly configured is crucial for a development team.

💡 **Use cases:**
- Rapid deployment of development or testing environments
- Secure, isolated application hosting
- Scaling applications without managing infrastructure

🛠️ **Steps to completion:**

1. **Create a resource group (if not already existing):**
   - Ensure the resource group `AZ500LAB01` is created.
     ```bash
     az group create --name AZ500LAB01 --location "East US"
     ```

2. **Create an Azure Container Instance:**
   - Deploy the container instance using the specified quickstart image and configuration.
     ```bash
     az container create --resource-group AZ500LAB01 --name mycontainer --image mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld:latest --cpu 1 --memory 1 --dns-name-label mycontainerdns --ports 80 --location "East US"
     ```

3. **Verify the deployment:**
   - Ensure that the container instance is running and accessible.
     ```bash
     az container show --resource-group AZ500LAB01 --name mycontainer --query "{FQDN:ipAddress.fqdn,Status:instanceView.state}" --output table
     ```

4. **Delete the resources created for this exercise:**
   - Remove the container instance and the resource group to avoid unnecessary costs.
     ```bash
     az container delete --resource-group AZ500LAB01 --name mycontainer --yes
     az group delete --name AZ500LAB01 --yes --no-wait
     ```

⚡ **Tip:**
Regularly assess whether you need the resources post-exercise to avoid extra costs.
