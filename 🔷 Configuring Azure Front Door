🔷 Configuring Azure Front Door

🎯 **Objective:**
Set up an Azure Front Door configuration to pool two instances of a web application in different Azure regions, ensuring traffic is directed to the nearest site and demonstrating automatic failover.

🌟 **Why does this matter?:**
Azure Front Door enhances the performance and reliability of web applications by directing traffic to the nearest available site and ensuring seamless failover in case of site unavailability.

💡 **Use cases:**
- Enhancing web application performance
- Ensuring high availability and failover
- Optimizing user experience by reducing latency

🛠️ **Steps to completion:**

1. **Create two instances of a web app:**
   - Use the Azure portal or Azure CLI to create two instances of a web application in different Azure regions.
     ```bash
     az webapp create --resource-group <resource_group_name> --plan <app_service_plan> --name <webapp1_name> --runtime "NODE|14-lts" --location <region1>
     az webapp create --resource-group <resource_group_name> --plan <app_service_plan> --name <webapp2_name> --runtime "NODE|14-lts" --location <region2>
     ```

2. **Create a Front Door for your application:**
   - Set up an Azure Front Door to route traffic to the web application instances.
     ```bash
     az network front-door create --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name <front_door_name> --backend-pool-name <backend_pool_name> --backend-pool-load-balancing-settings-name <load_balancing_settings_name> --backend-pool-health-probe-settings-name <health_probe_settings_name> --backend-address <webapp1_name>.azurewebsites.net <webapp2_name>.azurewebsites.net
     ```

3. **View Azure Front Door in action:**
   - Access the Front Door URL to verify that traffic is directed to the nearest site and demonstrates automatic failover.
     ```bash
     # Use a web browser to access the Front Door URL and observe the traffic routing behavior
     ```

4. **Delete resources:**
   - Remove the resources created for this exercise to avoid unnecessary costs.
     ```bash
     az group delete --name <resource_group_name> --yes --no-wait
     ```

⚡ **Tip:**
Regularly assess whether you need the resources post-exercise to avoid extra costs.
